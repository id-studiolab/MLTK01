MLTK01 is an open-source toolkit for prototyping _tangible learning things_ fast, built on top of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/).

Simply plug, train and play machine learning sketches.

This toolkit allows designers to cut out hardware prototyping time and <span class="highlight">focus on the design of interactions with tangible learning things</span>, giving space to explorations of unconventional data sources and to the creative craft of behaviors.

As we strive for open approaches to education, <span class="highlight">we combined hardware and software from two existing open source tools: Arduino and ml5js</span>.

- An [Arduino nano BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is connected to the MLTK01 PCB, functioning as a tangible interface. It allows you to simply plug, train and play with machine learning sketches.
- The MLTK01 library extends the [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) javascript library with a rich set of API to connect the browser with the board through [Web BLE API](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/), facilitating the process of reading sensors and controlling the physical actuators connected to the board.
