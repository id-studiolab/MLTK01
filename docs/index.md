##### An open-source toolkit for fast prototyping tangible _learning things_, build on top of (https://www.arduino.cc/ "Arduino") and (https://ml5js.org/ "ml5js").

toolkit for fast prototyping learning things / cut out hardware prototyping time and focus on what data to use and how to train, designing behaviours and thinking about the interactions.
in line with our open phylosophy, we combined two open source tools, the ml5js library as software, and arduino as hardware. We also designed a dedicated pcb that extending the capabilities of an Arduino Nano, let you simply plug it and play machine learning sketches thanks to its tangible training interface.
