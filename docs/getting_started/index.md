# Getting started

This guide will walk you through the steps of creating your first MLTK01 sketch.

## Prerequisites

If you have no previous experience creating a sketch using p5.js or working in JavaScript, I recommend you get familiar with the process before this tutorial. [This Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) from The Coding Train is a good place to start.

## Tools

For this tutorial, you will need:

- The **ðŸ¤–MLTK01 board**. If you do not have one, you can also recreate it using a breadboard as shown in the [about page](../about).
- An **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** and the **Arduino IDE**. You can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software); you'll only use the IDE to load the code to set up the Arduino Nano once.
- A **web browser**. Currently the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) is only supported by Google Chrome so please make sure to run your sketch with that browser.
- A **place to write your code**. You can use your favorite editor, like Atom or VSCode, or the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
