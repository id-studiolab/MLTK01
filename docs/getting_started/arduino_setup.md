# Arduino Setup

This short tutorial walks you through setting up the Nano 33 BLE Sense to work with the MLTK01 board and the MLTK.js library.

## 1. Download the Arduino IDE

If you haven't done so already, download the Arduino IDE.

## Next Steps

1. Download the Arduino Sketches from the Github Repository: [https://github.com/id-studiolab/MLTK01](https://github.com/id-studiolab/MLTK01)
2. Check which version of the Nano 33 BLE Sense you are using. It says it on the box (show picture) or on the board itself (show picture)
3. Open the corresponding Arduino Sketch. Show that you open the main file and the other things come with it.
4. Connect your board and try to upload the sketch. You will probably get errors. These are libraries you need to install.
5. Use the left hand option in the IDE to install all the libraries.
6. Once you successfully upload the code to the board, you are good to go.
