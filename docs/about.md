## THE TOOLKIT
MLTK01 is a toolkit aimed at facilitating the design and development of small Mahine learnign projects supported by physical hardware and sensors.

The toolkit is made of:
- An open source [MLTK01 development board](http://localhost:4000/about.html#mltk-board) also (easily reproducible at home),
- A software library,
- A set of example that will help you to get started.

The board comes pre-flashed with a custom firmware which exposes the board bluetooth property and it's intended to function in combination with a webpage running a js sketch which includes the MLTK01 library.
<span class="highlight">You won't have to write a line of Arduino code, the main logic of your code will be some js running in the browser just like [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches.</span>


## MLTK BOARD
![MLTK Board](../assets/board_components.png "MLTK01 Board")

The mltk board is based on the [Aarduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense){:target="_blank"}, a small Arduino board equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors:
- **9 axis inertial sensor:** what makes this board ideal for wearable devices
- **humidity, and temperature sensor:** to get highly accurate measurements of the environmental conditions
- **barometric sensor:** you could make a simple weather station
- **microphone:** to capture and analyse sound in real time
- **gesture, proximity, light color and light intensity sensor:** estimate the roomâ€™s luminosity, but also whether someone is moving close to the board.
For a full list of the Arduino Nano BLE sense features refer to [the official documentation](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense){:target="_blank"}

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE comes soldered on the bottom of the MLTK01 board and extends its functionality by providing a easy interface to interact with the Machine Learning Library. The interface features:
- **A train/play switch** to go from train mode to play mode and vice versa
- **A rotary encoder** to selecting the class to train
- **A rotary encoder** to selecting the class to train
- **A push button ** to record new data
- **An RGB led ring** to provide feedbacks
- **2 Grove connector** to attach external sensor and actuators (limited at the moment, you will need to modify the firmware and the library to interface this with external hardware)

The Board serves as a gateway to the physical world and doesn't do any machine learning Algoritm, most of the processing is in fact done on a computer (or smartphone) in a browser running a webpage which uses the MLTK library to interface with the board.
The Board and the browser are connected trough BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
